# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test --network local         
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node --fork HTTPENDPOINT
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network NETWORKNAME

```
Build using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/gfournieriExec/hardhat-starter-project.git
cd hardhat-starter-project
npm install
npm i @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan @openzeppelin/contracts
cp ~/Documents/Solidity/credentials.js ./
```
